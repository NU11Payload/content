# Raspberry Pi as a Workstation

Raspberry Pi has evolved from a simple educational computer to a capable workstation platform. Modern Raspberry Pi models, particularly the Pi 4 and Pi 5, have sufficient specifications to serve as lightweight workstations for development, office work, and general computing tasks when running Fedora Linux.

The [Raspberry Pi family](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) now includes models with multi-core processors, up to 8GB of RAM, multiple display outputs, and fast I/O capabilities. These specifications make certain Pi models suitable as primary or secondary workstations, especially for developers working on ARM-based projects, embedded systems, or those seeking an energy-efficient computing solution.

This guide focuses on using Raspberry Pi models as Fedora workstations, covering which models meet workstation specifications and how to optimize them for productive daily use.

## Workstation-Capable Models

### Recommended for Workstation Use

**Raspberry Pi 5** (2023) - Premium Workstation
With its ARM Cortex Proccessor which clocks in at 2,4GGHZ, and its RAM this would be the best opted in choice.


### Not Recommended for Workstation Use

The following models lack sufficient specifications for effective workstation use:

- Raspberry Pi Zero series (limited RAM and processing power)
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (Limited RAM and Processing Power)
- Raspberry Pi 2 and earlier models (insufficient RAM for modern Fedora desktop)

## Fedora Workstation on Raspberry Pi

Fedora provides official ARM images optimized for workstation use on Raspberry Pi. The Fedora Workstation edition includes GNOME desktop environment and essential productivity applications, making it suitable for daily computing tasks.

### Workstation Requirements

For optimal workstation performance, ensure your Pi meets these minimum specifications:

- **RAM**: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for heavy development work)
- **Storage**: Fast microSD card (UHS-I U3) or USB 3.0 SSD
- **Cooling**: Active cooling recommended for sustained workloads
- **Power**: Official Raspberry Pi power adapter or equivalent (3A for Pi 4/5)
